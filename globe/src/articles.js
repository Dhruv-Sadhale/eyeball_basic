    content: ` The existence of software inevitably raises the question of how decisions about its use should be made. For example, suppose one individual who has a copy of a program meets another who would like a copy. It is possible for them to copy the program; who should decide whether this is done? The individuals involved? Or another party, called the “owner”?
    Software developers typically consider these questions on the assumption that the criterion for the answer is to maximize developers' profits. The political power of business has led to the government adoption of both this criterion and the answer proposed by the developers: that the program has an owner, typically a corporation associated with its development.
    I would like to consider the same question using a different criterion: the prosperity and freedom of the public in general.
    This answer cannot be decided by current law—the law should conform to ethics, not the other way around. Nor does current practice decide this question, although it may suggest possible answers. The only way to judge is to see who is helped and who is hurt by recognizing owners of software, why, and how much. In other words, we should perform a cost-benefit analysis on behalf of society as a whole, taking account of individual freedom as well as production of material goods.
    In this essay, I will describe the effects of having owners, and show that the results are detrimental. My conclusion is that programmers have the duty to encourage others to share, redistribute, study, and improve the software we write: in other words, to write “free” software.(1)
    How Owners Justify Their Power.`

    content: `What comes first to your mind when you encounter the word License?
    Permissions, exactly!
    It is a official paper that shows if you’re allowed to do or have something.
    
    What is a “Software” License?
    A software license is a legally binding agreement made between the owner or developer of a software program and the user, outlining how they can use and distribute the product. Software licensing terms and conditions usually include fair use of the software, the limitations of liability, warranties, and disclaimers.
    
    What all things a Software License addresses?
    Typically, the software license addresses things like:
    
    If the user can view the underlying source code
    If the user can copy, alter, or redistribute the program
    Where the program can be installed and how frequently
    How does this apply to Open Source?
    Open Source License serves as a legal agreement between open
    source author and user. The author makes OSS available for free,
    but with certain requirements, the user must follow. An open-source
    license outlines the responsibilities taken on by those who use your
    Software. All licenses allow the use, modification, and sharing of software complying with the definition of Open Source.`

    content: `One of the most broadly used approach is Copyright.
    Copyright enables the creator to have a legal right to dictate whether or not his authentic work may be duplicated. The creator additionally has the rights to take legal moves if his work is discovered copied or altered through others without the creator’s permission. However, once you’ve protected your work with copyright, you can’t disclaim that right totally or add it to the public domain. Unauthorised utilisation of original work that is protected by Copyright is termed as Copyright Infringement. Restricting users from unauthorised copying, altering, or selling of the creator’s unique work is the primary motive behind Copyright.
    
    Types of Copyright:
    Copyright
    
    Public Performing Right
    Public Performance License
    Reproduction Right
    Mechanical License
    Synchronisation License
    On the other hand, Copyleft is just the reverse of Copyright.
    It promotes the technique of making any work reusable and modifiable without restrictions. Copyleft supports the intension of the Open-source movement, that emphasises the idea of collaboration. However, the most remarkable thing about copyleft licenses is that they require users to distribute by-product works beneath the same license that gives them the identical rights as the actual work. For instance, assume a developer releases a source code having a copyleft license. Being a user, you have the rights to download, alter and share the code to whomsoever you need according to your desire, but you’d also have to permit anyone else to download, alter and share the code to whomsoever they want. This is termed as “share-alike” Clause. Therefore, Copyleft guarantees that not only the original work is free, but that all modifications must also be made free for different users.
    
    Types of Copyleft:
    GNU GPL (for software)
    Creative Commons SA (Share Alike) licenses (for works of art).
    Mozilla Public License 2.0
    Eclipse Public License 1.0
    Microsoft Reciprocal License
    It’s usual to wonder how Copyleft is far distinct from Copyright, but to all intents and purposes, Copyleft utilises Copyright to make sure that the authentic works stays free. Copyright regulation enthrones the rights to the owner of the work in order to control all reproduction, modification, and use of the copyrighted material, whereas Copyleft utilises this regulation to impose freedom of use and provide upcoming users to alter, distribute, and use the work as per their wish.`

    content: `What is an Operating System?
    Operating System manages a computer and acts as an interface between user and computer. Operating system is the first program that starts when a computer is booted up. The operating system can be understood as a system software. A computer system necessarily requires an operating system to run. It is the first program that loads into main memory when the computer system boots.
    
    The primary function of an operating system is to provide an interface between the user and hardware. It also provides security to resources of the system. There are different types of operating systems available such as single user and multiuser OS, multiprocessor OS, real-time OS, distributed OS, etc.
    
    What is a Kernel?
    Kernel is the core component of the operating system and is responsible to convert user commands to machine level language commands. Kernel too is a system software, but it is a part of the operating system.
    
    The primary function of a Kernel is to provide an interface between the application and the hardware. Kernel also helps with memory management, disk management, process management and task management. All operating systems require a Kernel to run. There are different types of kernels such as Monolithic and Microkernel.`

    content: `How I got to know about EFF?
    Well, one of my friends told me about the ‘HTTPS Everywhere browser extension long ago when I asked him what that lock on the URL bar stood for. I was curious to know what it signifies when red or clean locked. Having installed it, I got suggestions for the ‘Privacy Badger’ extension, since both these extensions are tools by the EFF. I clicked on it and went on to read. This search soon landed me on the Electronic Frontier Foundation page!
    
    The Electronic Frontier Foundation is the leading nonprofit organization defending civil liberties in the digital world. Founded in 1990, EFF champions user privacy, free expression, and innovation through impact litigation, policy analysis, grassroots activism, and technology development. EFF's mission is to ensure that technology supports freedom, justice, and innovation for all people of the world.
    
    Mission : To ensure that technology supports freedom, justice, and innovation for all people of the world.
    
    The work of the foundation is currently focused on the following dimensions:
    free speech : defending the Internet and its open architecture as a platform for free speech
    fair use and intellectual property rights : defending the balance between fair use and intellectual property legislation (copyright, trademark, etc.), and ensure that the Internet and digital technologies continue to empower users as consumers, creators, innovators, scholars, and citizens;
    Innovation : protecting innovators and promoting creativity and competition;
    Privacy : promoting and defending the privacy rights of individuals in the digital environment, and supporting thde development of privacy-enhancing technologies;
    international activities : defending privacy, freedom of expression, digital consumer rights, and innovation at a global level, through capacity building activities, campaigns against legislative proposals and Internet treaties and conventions that threaten to undermine human rights, and advocacy to convince companies and governments to uphold human rights standards and the rule of law; and
    Transparency : demanding for and promoting transparency at a governmental level.

    Some of the noticeable works by EFF can be found here.`

    content: `Ever wondered why can’t we see the source code of Windows or MAC OS?
    Why do we pay for the operating system when buying a laptop or PC?
    Why we can install Linux OS freely but need to pay for Windows?
    Windows, MAC, Unix: You use them daily but don’t know how they actually work. Because these are closed-source programs that are copyrighted and not available for further research or use. You may have also heard of or used the UNIX OS which is a closed source.
    There was a need for an open-source OS, a freeware whose code is freely available and can be modified and distributed. Free doesn’t necessarily mean free of cost, here free stands for free use. Free Software
    Hence, GNU!
    
    But what exactly is GNU?
    
    The GNU Project
    GNU Project was announced by Richard Stallman in 1983. The aim was to develop and publish software collaboratively and allow users to use them freely, copy and distribute.
    The GNU Manifesto:
    
    Freedom to run a program for any purpose
    Freedom to study the mechanics of the program and modify it
    Freedom to redistribute copies
    Freedom to improve and change modified versions for public use
    To implement this manifesto, even the operating system needed to be free software.
    That’s why GNU/Linux was developed!
    
    The GNU Operating System
    GNU stands for GNU’s Not Unix! Meaning it is UNIX-like but is free software and does not contain UNIX-like code. GNU is licensed by GNU General Public License (GNU GPL).
    
    GNU is a collection of free softwares which can be used as an operating system or can be used in parts with other operating systems.
    Most of the time GNU is also referred to as GNU/Linux or simply Linux, as it uses a UNIX-like kernel Linux.
    Why does GNU come with Linux?
    GNU is just the source code or the software developed under the GPL. But it cannot be used as it is. It requires an OS to interpret the computer. So, it is combined with the Unix-like Open Source Kernel, Linux. These together are popularly known as GNU/Linux or Linux or GNU.
    GNU not only developed an operating system, but it also grew a worldwide open-source community! And by reading and accepting the ideology, you are a part too :).
